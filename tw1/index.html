<!--
  Doctype is not HTML element.
  It is more like a 'meta' message to the browser.
  It is used to tell the browser that page is structured
  used HTML5 - latest standard.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
  'html' is a root element.
  All the other tags must go inside it.
-->
<html lang="en">

<!--
  'head' is used to group the information
  (about your website or web application)
  and provide to the browser as additional
  information. It is also used to 'link' other files
  (i.e. CSS) to your HTML page.
-->
<head>

    <!--
      A lot of 'meta' data can be included into
      the 'head' but in this example to keep it simple
      only 'title' is used. 'title' is the title of the webpage
      that appears in the browser tab bar.
    -->
    <title>My webapp</title>
</head>

<body>
<!-- Logo placeholder of the webapp -->
<!--
  For logo placeholder text 'h1' tag is used.
  'h' means heading and numbers (1-6) are used to
  indicate the size of the text inside the very text.
  1 - the biggest, 6 - smallest heading.
-->
<h1>My web app</h1>

<!-- Navigation of the webapp -->
<!--
  For navigation 'nav' tag is used. Inside the 'nav'
  tag we have 'ul' tag for unordered list with group of
  'li' tags for list item.

  Each list item have 'a' tag with 'href' attribute
  that serve as a link to specific route.
-->

<nav>
    <!-- Navigation items collection -->
    <ul>
        <!-- First navigation item -->
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>

        <!-- Second navigation item -->
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>

        <!-- Third navigation item -->
        <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>

<!-- Intro text of the webapp -->
<!--
  For adding regular text content to the page
  'p' element can be used. 'p' means paragraph.
 -->
<p>This web app does nothing useful. Yay!</p>
